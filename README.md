## **📝 Project Overview**  

The **Question Answering (Seq2Seq)** project is an innovative **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** endeavor that aims to create an advanced sequence-to-sequence model capable of answering questions with precision and context awareness. This project harnesses state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to bridge the communication gap between humans and machines, paving the way for applications like:  
- Intelligent chatbots  
- Interactive educational tools  
- Enhanced information retrieval systems  

---

## **🎯 Objectives**  

1. Implement a **Seq2Seq model** tailored for question-answering tasks.  
2. Train the model on diverse datasets for robust understanding and generation of human-like responses.  
3. Assess model performance using industry-standard metrics and benchmarks.  
4. Deliver an intuitive, user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the model.
