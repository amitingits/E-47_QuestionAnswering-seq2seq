# Introduction
The Questioning/Answering (Seq2Seq) project is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) initiative designed to develop a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for generating answers to questions based on provided context. This project leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to facilitate effective communication between humans and machines, making it a valuable tool for various applications, including chatbots, educational tools, and information retrieval systems.
# Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
* Implement a Seq2Seq model for question answering tasks.
* Train the model on diverse datasets to enhance its ability to understand and generate human-like responses.
* Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics and benchmarks.
* Provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the model.
# Features
* Seq2Seq Model Architecture: Utilizes encoder-decoder architecture for processing input questions and generating coherent answers.
* Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes data cleaning, tokenization, and embedding techniques to prepare input data for training.
* Training and Evaluation: Comprehensive training scripts with options for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
* User Interface: A simple command-line or web-based interface for users to input questions and receive answers in real-time.
* Documentation and Examples: Detailed documentation and example use cases to help users understand how to utilize the model effectively.
