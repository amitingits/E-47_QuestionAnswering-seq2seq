
# **BART Implementation for Question Answering (Seq2Seq) Model**

---

## **üìñ Overview**  

This repository contains the implementation of a **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer)** model designed for **Question Answering** tasks using a Seq2Seq approach. The model utilizes contextual inputs and question prompts to generate accurate and coherent answers.  

---

## **üöÄ How It Works**  

1. **Question Answering Process**:  
   - Input format:  
     ```
     "question: <your question> context: <context>"
     ```  
   - The model processes this input to generate answers that align with the provided context.  

2. **Deployment**:  
   - The implementation has been deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for real-time interaction.  
   - Access the live application here: [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amithugs/Seq2Seq-Question-Answering)
