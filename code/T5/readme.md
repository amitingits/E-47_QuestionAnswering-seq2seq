# T5 Model Summarization and Question Answering

This repository provides code for a T5 model that performs summarization and question-answering tasks. The model can generate concise summaries or answer specific questions based on given context.

## Features

1. **Summarization**:
   - Processes long text inputs to generate short summaries.
   - Specify inputs with the prompt "summarize:" for T5 compatibility.

2. **Question Answering**:
   - Use context and questions as inputs, e.g., `"question: <your question> context: <context>"`.
   - The model returns answers based on context using a question-prompt format.
